# RougeTiler
C# porting of [hauberk](https://github.com/munificent/hauberk) with a little abuse of course.
# Why the Port
I essentially wanted to brush up my coding skills and knew in the past programming a game really forced me to explore different parts of the the language I was learning at the time. So after doing a little exploring I found the Hauberk and love the principles of seperation I found when looking through the code base. So, naturally I tried porting it to the language I love programming in, C#.
# What's Different
The main difference in game mechanics are:
  - Grinding: around trying to stop the grinding ability when revisiting the same level/stage.
  - Player Input: different platform forced me to try another way
  - Display UI: different platform meant i needed to approach the "effects" differently. (TODO)
  - Game Persistance: the way the saved game operates if sligthly different due to the need to persist the levels/stages.
 
# Helping Out
I'd love to have more people involved. You're more than welcome to contribute to RougeTiler itself. 
I really dont want to give any directions to where or what you may want to change. So feel free to have ago at something and the let me know.

My intention is that when more people are involved we'll get more organsied and come up with a road map of features then we can outline a plan of development as a whole team.

# License
Like Munificent, I wish to allow you to use the code base anyway you would like. It uses a MIT license like the original Hauberk, so you can do pretty much whatever you want with it.

All I ask is that we continue the "Free to Give" policy that Munificent started here.
